# HemoGuard
HemoGuard uses AI and a small blood sample to help diagnose and detect any anomalies in a person's circulatory system.

# About this prototype
Due to budgetary constraints, this prototype only collect mass spectrometry data. It'll use AI to efficiently categorise any anomalies, including cancers, and send off the data to a remote server to confirm its theory. The additional data received from the server will not be used in production, but is simply used to add more data to the dataset for training purposes.
